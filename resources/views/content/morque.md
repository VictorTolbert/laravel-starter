# Morgue file

A **morgue file** originally was the paper-folders containing 
old files and notes that were kept by criminal investigators, 
and old article clippings kept by newspaper reporters, in 
case they became of later use as a quick-reference.

In modern usage, its scope has expanded to cover many 
post-production materials for use of reference, or an 
inactive job file. The term is popular in the newspaper 
business to describe the file that holds past issues 
flats. The term has also been used by illustrators, 
comic book artists, [designers][1] and teachers.
