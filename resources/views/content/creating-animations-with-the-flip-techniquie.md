# Create Animations With the FLIP Technique

[David Khourshid][1] shows you how you can design meaningful UI animations with guidance from the FLIP principle


## Transitioning Between Views

When moving from one view to another in a mobile app, focal elements often smoothly animate from one position to another between views.

Examples of this include:

- Expanding a photo from a grid gallery
- Reordering table rows or list items
- Remaining items filling the empty space when single items are deleted
- An item visibly dropping into a shopping cart
- One line of text shifting vertically when a new line appears below it
- A button expanding or contracting when its contents changes
