# Introduction to Interaction Flows

## Microinteractions

- **Triggers**: the user-initiated or system-initiated action that starts the microinteraction _(Example: a submit button, a light switch)_
- **Rules**: the capabilities and constraints in the microinteraction; what can and cannot be done in a microinteraction _(Example: a date picker for an airline allows you to select departure and returns dates but neither date can be in the past)_
- **Feedback**: the visual cues that tell the user what is happening _(Example: a red warning icon appears when the userâ€™s password is incorrect, the flash on the screen when a user takes a screenshot, the dwindling character count as you type out your tweet)_
- **Loops**: the repeatability and lifecycle of a microinteraction _(Example: a software update modal will pop up whenever your device detects that a new update is available)_
- **Modes**: the different versions or states of an element _(Example: a read-only mode versus an edit-mode)_
