## Videa Transact - Customizable Columns

So what is the latest feature created for Videa Transact that will have an 
impact across our platform in other data tables? It's customizable columns 
of course! With the user feedback, we went to the drawing board and 
developed a solution that allows our users to customize their data tables. 

Users can sort columns by moving them up or down in sequence. Using a 
drop-down selection, they can select how many rows they want to view. What
about row height? We have a solution for that too because users can select 
the default, minimum, or maximum row height. If they don't like any of 
their changes, no problem; they can click Reset to restore the default 
table settings. 

All of this to ensure our users have a great experience when viewing their 
data. Sprint 89 is the target sprint the Apollo team plans to build this 
feature, and it will be implemented later this Fall in Videa Transact. Any 
questions, feel free to reach out to Jerome Thompson.

### Book Discovery -- The Grammar Devotional 

English is a messy language. 

So says Mignon Fogarty (aka Grammar Girl) in the introduction to her book 
The Grammar Devotional - Daily Tips for Successful Writing. Ms. Fogarty is 
the founder of the Quick and Dirty Tips website, which makes grammar very 
digestible. 

The book, too, is very digestible because it's written like a spiritual 
devotional with enough daily tips to span a year. The book's tone is light 
and helpful and discusses irregularities we face in our messy language. 

For example, do you know why we're taught to not split an infinitive 
(to run, to walk, etc.)? It's a Latin form and all infinitives are one 
word; you cannot split them. In the topic A Tough Breakup: Splitting 
Infinitives Ms. Fogarty says "English isn't Latin, after all" and as such, 
rules have loosened. James T. Kirk can say "To boldly go" with confidence. 

### DATA TABLE EXPERIMENTATION 

There are a number of methodologies for creating design systems to address 
the unique concerns of creating. Take a look at our exploration of a few of 
them for improving our data tables in the pattern laboratory.

### WHAT IS GRAMMARLY APP?

The Grammarly website offers a spelling and word usage app. There’s a 
version for Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Suite, and Windows. When you 
create an account, Grammarly generates a profile that allows you to 
specify American or British writing rules and to create a personal 
dictionary of words to ignore. From our experience, the apps work 
well with one caveat; the Ctrl+Z undo command is not available when 
the Grammarly checker is turned on.

### An Introduction to the Atomic Design Methodology

My search for a methodology to craft interface design systems led me 
to look for inspiration in other fields and industries. Given this 
amazingly complex world we’ve created, it seemed only natural that 
other fields would have tackled similar problems we could learn from 
and appropriate.
