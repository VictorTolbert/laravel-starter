The Price Guide allows you to:

Manage rates, ratings, and pricing expectations

See every rate and rating before they are available to the buyer through the Videa platform
If you want your reps to be able to access your Price Guide, you must give them access in the Videa Settings page. See Allow Sales Rep Access to Your Price Guide for more information.
