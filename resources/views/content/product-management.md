## Coursera SPM Notes

### Better Software Viewpoints 

- validated - The Right Software
  It meets their needs, solves their problem, and they are happy with it
- verified - Done Right
  The software implementation conforms to a specified design, and in turn, the design satisfies a stated set of requirements. Developers can conduct reviews and tests to ensure the requirements, design, and implementation line up and do not have defects
- managed - Everyone is clear on the next steps
  The idea is to adopt just enough process and suitable practices to organize the work of everyone involved.

  **Consequently, to achieve better software, three goals are: the right product, done right, and managed right.**
