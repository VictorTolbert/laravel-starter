            <h2 class="subtitle">Videa's makegoods solution pulls pre-empts through the nightly traffic pull. At that point, Videa addresses the pre-empt, attempts to find a makegood solution (if Videa finds a makegood solution, we re-avail through the Videa system), and sends the order to the station and agency simultaneously (pre-booking inventory and earmarking avails).

The agency is allowed 48 hours to approve makegoods. If the agency does not respond within 48 hours, the station or the rep should reach out to the agency buyer.

If you want your reps to be able to create makegoods, you must explicitly give them that permission on the Settings screen. See Allow Sales Rep Access to Your Makegoods for more information.
