        Simplified sales process
        Revenue projections are easier to achieve. We align with each station’s unique sales strategy and automate transactional parts of the selling process so you can focus on selling.
        Reduce manual research processes with built-in ratings research from Nielsen and comScore (formally Rentrak)
        Videa absorbs estimating burden so you can optimize pricing


        Minimize time to market
        Sell weeks or quarters in advance, near real-time
        Buyer provides specs online; Videa returns the right inventory in seconds
        Videa reduces and manages under-delivered weight and makegoods


        Maximize inventory
        Buyers access up to four years of historical traffic data – regardless of multiple traffic systems across station groups, seasonality, system upgrades or data purge
        Videa “smooths” the data and removes unnecessary noise
        Provides access to your entire TV inventory schedule

        Automate the buying process, not the deal.
        Media buyers access a station’s full inventory.
        Transactions are based on buyer’s criteria.
        Pricing is approved by the station.
