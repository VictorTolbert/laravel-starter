## Create MakeGood Offers-MG Entry screen with 3 grids

1.  The ‘Classification’ dropdown width is to be increased, and font is to be changed to be the same as in OM 
2.  The ‘Totals’ column width is to be increased to display its values entirely (the ‘Spots’ column width may be decreased)
3.  The 1st grid name is to be ‘Pre-Empt(s)’ instead of ‘Open Pre-empts(s)’


1.  The 1st and 3rd grids’ font is larger than the 2nd – it would be better to make it the same in all the grids – like in the 2nd grid
2.  The 3rd grid search area – ‘DPs Availed’ link should be underlined to look like a link
3.  The 3rd grid search area - ‘Start Time’ and ‘End Time’ labels’ font differs from the font used for other labels
4.  The 3rd grid search area  - Days dropdown should be inactive when Program line isn’t selected
5.  The 2nd grid – ‘Start Time’ and ‘End Time’ values are to be black, not blue

1.  The ‘Dayparts’ and ‘Spot Length’ dropdowns’ width is to be increased to display all the values in one row
2.  The 3rd grid - the ‘Guidelines Warnings / Violations’ column disappears after search is performed
3.  The 3rd grid - Spots cells are to be shown under appropriate dates
4.  Spots cells should look like in OM in Edit mode (when we select a Program)

## MG Main screen

1.  There are no arrows - white arrow is shown only after click the area - black arrows should be always shown and should fit the grid
2.  AGENCY INVOICE DETAILS broken layout of grid when check the 'Show Spot Allocations' checkbox
3.  MAKEGOODS - additional empty column on right
    
1. AGENCY INVOICE DETAILS - when empty line are not aligned with rest grid (rows height is small)

1.  Accepted by station: 'Recalled' were colored in red, now - all are colored in black

## Open Preempt listing

1. Both date fields to not allow you to just type in 01/01/2016. The year portion of the date field is strange and changing what I type (Bug was created)
2. This scroll is messed up
3. There is a double horizontal scroll which is wrong
4. Page is missing pagination (e.g. 1 of 1 pages)

## Active Order Listing

1. Reduce the width of Advertiser Column and increase the width of Start Date and End Date columns so the full year is visible
