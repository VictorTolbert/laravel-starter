## Sitepath Diagramming


**Purpose**
Helps visualize what sorts of activities a product's users will try to accomplish and how those differenct activities are related to one another.

1. Represent each type of user for the product.
2. Draw a user's entrance, their events within the system, and their exit.
3. Repeat for each user type.

## Topic Mapping

**Purpose**
A brainstorming tool used to generate a structure for a product's information.

1. Write the product's key topic.
2. Generate items associated with the key topic.
3. Generate items associated with the items you just added. Repeat until all items are exhausted.


## Free Listing

**Purpose**
To understand the scope and contents of a domain.

**Collecting**
In this example, 20 people are asked to name kinds of videos. (The more agreement within a particular domain, the fewer respondents are needed.)

**Crunching**
Charting the average number of times each item was listed by the respondents helps understand the core, middle, and the peripheral items within the domain.

**Comparing**
A **co-occurence matrix** charts how many times pairs of items both appeared on respondents lists. This data can be used for **multidimensional scaling.**


## Card Sorting

To understand how users group information within a particular domain. This can help create or revise a product's hierarchical organization.


**Method**
Test participants organize cards representing specific types of information.

**Open sort**
When launching a new product or if a complete reorganization of an existing product is possible, test participants can label their own categories for the sorted information.

**To avoid test participants giving a new category for every item***:
Suggest a range for the final number of categories (four to eight, for example).
*OR*
Allow successive card slots where test participants can collapse categories into progressively more encompassing categories.

**Closed sort**
When reorganizing or making improvements to an existing architecture, test participants are asked to organize cards under existing categories.

**Variations***
1. You should consider NOT allowing a miscellaneous category.
2. You should consider allowing participants to put the same item under more than one category.

**Resolving the results**
From "Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web" by Christina Wodtke: 

1. **Look for the dominant organization scheme among all results.** Typically, one will emerge.
2. **Adjust scheme to make kinds of categories consistent.** For example, Breakfast - Appetizers -- Italian -- Main Course -- Side Dishes -- Tofu -- Drinks -- Dessert can be condensed into Appetizer -- Main Course -- Dessert ... without losing the spirit of the test results
3. **Set aside the odd categories that don't match.** Look for odd categories created by more than one person. Sometimes they suggest criteria for how people are looking for information and can be addressed with solutions outside of the overall organizing scheme.

but essential -- but he sensual
Didn't distill -- didn’t he still
Dominant -- dumb and it


## Personas




**Purpose**
By creating archetypes that represent the users of a product, products can be more user-centric.

**Using personas**
Personas have value in every phase of product development:

1. **Defining the problem** -- Personas focus on specific user characteristics, this creates a hierarchy, and hierarchy forces tough (but essential) decisions.
2. **Developing the solution** -- Solution can be tested against personas
3. **Building the solution**, and
4. **Launching the product** --Personas maintain cross departmental cohesion
5. **Evolving the product** -- Regular testing of product against personas can expose need for change and growth

## Developing personas

**According to Cooper**
The folks at consulting firm Cooper developed personas by interviewing the current users and/or potential users of the product. They didn’t distill characteristics learned in the interviews to represent distinct sets of use her behavior patterns in goals.

**According to razor fish**
Much of the chagrin of Alan Cooper, some folks want to use a more quantitative approach to developing personas. (Cooper argues that demographics shed light on the sales process, not the development process. In the redesign of the Ford Motor Company website, consulting firm Razorfish used statistical data about Ford customers to guide who they would interview and how the distilled characteristics would be organized.

**Filling either of those approaches, plan C**
When I led a development of personas as the Director of Site Development at washingtonpost.com, I didn’t have the buy-in I needed in order to talk to our users. The use of personas and IA tools in general were treated like voodoo buy some key mid- and senior level managers. To stay under the corporate radar, I used an alternative approach to developing personas for a project to overhaul our Customer Care services.

The Web is about a single user in the information they choose to experience, then the user goal is the Web's dominant, core component. So we used user goals to create our personas:

**Step 1: Brainstorming use your goals**
Picture an upside down triangle basically an arrow pointing down use your goals that are too broad occur at the widest area of the triangle and or difficult to address in any real way with product development. I live in Brainstorm by a cross departmental team to generate use your goals that could be satisfied but I deal Washington Post.com customer care services goals that were too broad is still to be as specific as possible I want to be informed became I want to know how to place an ad which we realize really meant I want to place an ad which was really a task to satisfy the true use her go I want to sell my car

**Step 2: Cluster use her goals**
We played around with different combinations of user goals into archetypes emerged:

"I want to sell my car."
"I want to know how to watch the video about Nagasaki."
"I want to submit a movie review and I don’t understand your instructions."
...could come from: 
People who want to learn or need to learn in order to get what they want.


"I want to know that the correction I sent in was received." 
"I got a "We are unable to locate the page you requested" message and now I want to know what to do."" 
...could come from:
People who want to thing they’re talking about right away and they can’t do it themselves.

"I want to give Michael Wilbon a story idea."
"I want a job at the washingtonpost.com"
"I want to tell someone at wp.com that I like potato salad." 
...could come from: 
People who Want more than an answer or piece of content, they want something deeper.

**Step 3: Create personas**

## Primary personas

There still seems to be some variation in the definition of the primary persona:

**Alan Cooper:** "To be primary, a persona is someone who must be satisfied, but who cannot be satisfied with an interface designed for any other persona."  Cooper used a primary persona in his book that represented a tiny percentage of his clients business, but who was the perfect key to his client's product puzzle.

**Christina Wodtke:** "Your primary persona needs to be a common user type who is both important to the business success of the product and needy from a design point of view -- in other words, a beginner user or a technologically challenged one."

**Mike experienc** The idea of a single primary persona completely freaked out some of the washingtonpost.com managers I’ve dealt with. "But we want to be great for aaaaaaaall of our users!!!"" they objected. I was never able to get them to support personas, or put resources toward the satisfaction of specific user types if it was at the expense of others. As a result, all of our users ended up list satisfied.
