                            <p>These Frequently-Asked Questions give you some basics on how the <span class="GeneralCompanyName">Videa</span> system works for you.</p>
                            <h3 class="FAQheading">Who is <span class="GeneralCompanyName">Videa</span>?</h3>
                            <p>Backed by Cox, <span class="GeneralCompanyName">Videa</span> was created to deliver the only live, supply-side marketplace for full schedule, forward reserve broadcast TV station inventory that can be ordered weeks or quarters in advance.</p>
                            <p>We come from TV and are passionate about maximizing the value of television.  So we built the technology that works the way sellers and buyers transact today, except we’ve built it to also support a more automated sales process that allows for efficient negotiation. Plus, it reinforces order transparency and optimized, station-controlled pricing.</p>
                            <p>We also offer order stewardship services and avails delivered to the buyer in seconds.</p>
                            <p>Buying and selling media shouldn’t have to be so time consuming; with <span class="GeneralCompanyName">Videa</span>, it won’t be.</p>
                            <h3 class="FAQheading">How Does <span class="GeneralCompanyName">Videa</span> Work?</h3>
                            <p>We automate the buying process, not the deal.  The station makes its full inventory available for purchase through <span class="GeneralCompanyName">Videa</span>. Buyers can access automated, full schedule, forward reserve, local inventory is delivered in seconds.</p>
                            <p>We normalize the traffic, optimize pricing for that inventory, and then facilitate the purchase.</p>
                            <p>Videa can work with any traffic system or demand-side buying platform to keep each station aligned with its unique sales strategy. Transactions are based on the media buyer’s criteria and pricing is approved by the station.</p>
                            <h3 class="FAQheading">What's being Automated? What's "Programmatic"?</h3>
                            <p><span class="GeneralCompanyName">Videa</span> has automated the parts of the sales process that are cumbersome – for example, avails, makegoods, and posting. Our technology works the way sellers and buyers transact today, except we’ve built it to also support a more automated sales process. Our end-to-end campaign management system also happens to allow for efficient negotiation.</p>
                            <p>We’re not just robots replacing people; <span class="GeneralCompanyName">Videa</span>’s order stewardship offers human touch points that support:</p>

A rating should not be confused with share, which is a percentage of people using a media delivery vehicle at a particular time.</span></a> delivery tracking</li>

                            <h3 class="FAQheading">What is a Sell-Side Platform?</h3>
                            <p><span class="GeneralCompanyName">Videa</span>’s sell-side platform was built for local TV stations and their station groups.</p>
                            <p><span class="GeneralCompanyName">Videa</span>’s marketplace provides full schedule, forward-reserve broadcast TV station inventory that can be ordered weeks or quarters in advance.  Our sell-side solution:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li value="1">Automates the buying process – We automate the buying process, not the deal. The station makes its full inventory available for purchase through <span class="GeneralCompanyName">Videa</span>. We normalize the traffic, optimize pricing for that inventory, and then facilitate the purchase.</li>
                                <li value="2">Simplifies the sales process – <span class="GeneralCompanyName">Videa</span> can work with any traffic system or demand-side buying platform to keep each station aligned with its unique sales strategy. Plus, stations can reduce their manual research processes with built-in, data-driven ratings research from <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">Nielsen<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>A research firm that collects media usage data for broadcast TV, cable TV, and interactive advertising.

                                <li value="3">Minimizes your time to market – Sell weeks or quarters in advance, near real-time.

                                <li value="4">Maximizes your value – <span class="GeneralCompanyName">Videa</span> enables buyers to easily access local inventory, increasing demand and generating more revenue for the station.

                            <h3 class="FAQheading">What is "Normalized" Traffic?</h3>
                            <p>We understand it’s common for broadcast groups to have different traffic systems, and historical data can be difficult to analyze since it requires significant cleaning and can span multiple source systems, or it can be difficult to access after a system upgrade.</p>
                            <p><span class="GeneralCompanyName">Videa</span>’s technology collects, transforms, and processes up to four years of historical traffic data – regardless whether multiple traffic systems exist across station groups.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li value="1">We securely pull in four years of historical traffic data using <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">TVB<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Television Bureau of advertising.</span></a> and BXF standards to facilitate usage.</li>
                                <li value="2">We then “smooth” the data by removing noise, seasonality, specials, and anything out of the ordinary the station ran to find a pattern, allowing us to see the TV viewer numbers with more granularity.</li>
                                <li value="3">Once the pattern is established, seasonality is added back in and fed into the <span class="GeneralCompanyName">Videa</span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">Inventory<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Commercial spots available on a station. Also known as avails.</span></a> Management System</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3 class="FAQheading">How is <span class="GeneralCompanyName">Videa</span> Going to Evolve in the Future?</h3>
                            <p>Over the next two years, we will continue to focus on our commercial platform in order to make sure that we are well positioned for the market needs of the future. The launching of the TV industry’s first programmatic marketplace, our first solution, provides direct access to station inventory and the ability to schedule media buys – up to a year in advance. We’re pleased with the success that we’ve had thus far and look forward to building on this in the months ahead.</p>
